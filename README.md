This project showcases a responsive and interactive personal portfolio website, thoughtfully designed to highlight my skills, experience, and projects as a computer science student and aspiring web developer. The design, in collaboration with Agustina Lorda, prioritizes usability and aesthetics, featuring dynamic elements such as a dark mode toggle and engaging hover effects.
The "Projects" section provides categorized, detailed descriptions of my work for seamless navigation, while the "Skills" and "Experience" sections present my expertise with visually appealing layouts and concise content.
Built using semantic HTML for structure, styled with CSS variables for effortless theme customization, and enhanced with JavaScript for interactivity, the portfolio delivers a cohesive, modern, and professional user experience.
